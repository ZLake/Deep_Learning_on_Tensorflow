# Homework 1 
* Please follow the code in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb to generate notMNIST.pickle for later training.
* You can download notMNIST_large.tar.gz and notMNIST_small.tar.gz from http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/books1000/notMNIST_large.tar.gz and http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/books1000/notMNIST_small.tar.gz.

### Neural Network
put notMNIST.pickle in the folder and run notMNIST_simple.py first, then you can run:
* simple NN
* simple NN with regularization
* 2-layer NN (MLP) (with regularization and dropout) 
* simple CNN (with maxpooling and learning rate decay)
* lenet-5 CNN
