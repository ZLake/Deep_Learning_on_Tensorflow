# Homework 1 
* Please run notMNIST_simple.py first to download notMNIST data and generate notMNIST.pickle for later training.
* You can modify the train,valid and test size in notMNIST_simple.py. 
### Neural Network
Once notMNIST.pickle is generated, then you can run:
* simple NN
* simple NN with regularization
* 2-layer NN (MLP) (with regularization and dropout) 
* simple CNN (with maxpooling and learning rate decay)
* lenet-5 CNN
